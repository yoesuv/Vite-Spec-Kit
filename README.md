# Vite + Spec Kit

Personal research about spec-driven development using [Github Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)

### Constitution

```
declare principles for clean code, simple UX, responsive design, user experience consistency, performance requirements and minimal dependencies. no testing unit (no unit test, no integration test, etc) - this must supersede any other guidance.
```
